**Description of Topic:**
The topic of my project: Measuring the diversity/representation of artists and objects within Tate’s collection. 


**Questions of interest:**


*Gender Diversity.* Are there any trends in acquisition, specifically in the accessions of women vs men?

*Collection Diversity.* Are there any trends or preferences that exist with the types of objects chosen to be a part of the collection? 

*Artist Diversity.* Are there any trends in the collection regarding the artist’s location of birth? 

*Acquisition History.* During which time periods were there more/less of a trend in acquiring artwork?
