**Description of Topic:**


For my DH140 Final Project, I am analyzing + contextualizing Tate's collection of artworks, specifically measuring the diversity/representation of artists and objects within Tate’s collection.

Overall, the value that this project brings is a chance to examine 1 museum with scrutiny and see whether or not there has been any progress in these areas. In my data visualizations, findings, and analysis, I am looking at the Tate Collection's Gender Diversity, Collection Diversity, Artist Birth Locations, and Acquisition History.

DEAI in all aspects of a museum (or any cultural institution) are vital to their own future relevance, sustainability, and this project seeks to explore these themes.

**Questions of interest:**


*Gender Diversity.* Are there any trends in acquisition, specifically in the accessions of women vs men?

*Collection Diversity.* Are there any trends or preferences that exist with the types of objects chosen to be a part of the collection? 

*Artist Diversity.* Are there any trends in the collection regarding the artist’s location of birth? 

*Acquisition History.* During which time periods were there more/less of a trend in acquiring artwork?
