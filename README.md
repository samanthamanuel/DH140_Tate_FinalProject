# DH140_Tate_FinalProject



**Description of Topic:**
The topic of my project: Measuring the diversity/representation of artists and objects within Tate’s collection. 


**Questions of interest:**


**Gender Diversity.** Are there any trends in acquisition, specifically in the accessions of women vs men? (looking also to maybe note under which museum Director the objects were acquired)
**Collection Diversity.** Are there any trends or preferences that exist with the types of objects chosen to be a part of the collection? 
**Artist Diversity.** Are there any trends in the collection regarding the artist’s location of birth? 
**Acquisition History.** During which time periods were there more/less of a trend in acquiring artwork?
